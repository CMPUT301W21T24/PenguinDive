CMPUT 301 Team 24 Meeting Focused on Project Part 3
______________________________________________________________________________
Meeting Minutes:
Discussion on the division of part 3, as well as discussing the coding. 
Coding of the main activity and fragments, as well as experiments and trials. 
If the Experiments/Trials/Main Activity/Fragments are finished by Tuesday, then do Profiles by Thursday. 
Code is distributed with multiple people assigned, as collaboration can help reduce time spent by finding bugs, etc.
This should get us to around 1/2 done the project, and the next week can be spent to do the last 1/6th (or more, if we're up for it) to get the project to 2/3 completion. 


WORK DISTRIBUTION:

Experiments/Trials: 
Kevin Zhu
Matthew Fournier
Ryan Brooks

Main Activity/Fragments:
Tyler Bach
Nikita Adekar
Linrui Wu


Deadline:
Finish the Experiment Class - Tuesday March 9, 2021.
Finish the Profile implementation - Thursday March 11, 2021.

Concerns: Once we finish this part will we be in a rush to finish part 4 with finals and midterms. This is the reason we're following this schedule, as more work will be done sooner.
The more work we finish early, the less problems we'll have with complications later on. 


Next meetings:
Check-in: Saturday March 6, 2021, 3PM MST
Tuesday March 9, 2021, 1PM MST
