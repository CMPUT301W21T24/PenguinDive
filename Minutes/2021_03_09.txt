Summary: Raising quesitons and concerns in regards to workload. Clarifying future goals.
	
	- Tyler mentioned changing the search functionality to not be a fragment, but be imbedded in the activity that shows all experiments
		- Currently using searchview, Nikita mentioned possibility of regex
		- Will require change in uml and story board
		
	- Profiles class having two constructors
