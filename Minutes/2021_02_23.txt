CMPUT 301 Team 24 Meeting Focused on Project Part 2
______________________________________________________________________________
Minutes


Division of Project 2 into 2 groups:

Group 1 (Nikita, Ryan, Tyler): In charge of { 
Product Backlog:
Form the initial partial user stories into a backlog of the product's requirements. For each user story, complete its rationale, its estimated size in story points, and risk level (i.e., low, medium, or high). These requirements will likely evolve and should be maintained up-to-date throughout the project. Make sure they are numbered for easy reference.
Tool use:
Consistent use of tools such as github to track files. No use of google drive or dropbox to share files. Effective use of issue tracker.
Separation of work:
Ryan: US 01.01.01 US 01.04.01 US 01.09.01 US 02.01.01 US 03.01.01
Nikita: US 01.02.01 US 01.05.01 US 01.06.01 US 02.02.01 US 03.02.01
Tyler: US 01.03.01 US 01.08.01 US 01.07.01 US 02.03.01 US 03.03.01
Group 2 (Linrui, Kevin, Matt): In charge of {
User Interface Mockups and Storyboard Sequences:
Diagram the layout of your main user interface and major dialogs, with comments describing the important elements. Also, diagram storyboard sequences of using your application, with transitions between different states of the user interface, caused by the user manipulating the controls or providing input. Within the diagrams, reference the relevant requirements. Convincingly show all the requirements are covered.

Object-Oriented Analysis:
Document your initial object-oriented analysis using a UML class diagram (or diagrams), focusing on the most important anticipated classes, interfaces, and relationships. Add notes if the purpose of a class, interface, or relationship is likely not clear to an outsider. The diagram(s) will likely evolve.

Separation of work:
 
Each person can help each other with this, itâ€™s very loose as long as everyone does a good amount of work
Kevin: uml 
Matt: interface 
Rui: uml



Deadline for individual parts is Tuesday 23rd.
